ize (pronounced like "eyes") is a powerful command-line tool designed
for red teams to enhance collaboration and streamline artifact collection
during engagements. With ize, red team members can efficiently share critical
information and securely store artifacts for centralized access and reporting.

## Key Features:

- Collaborative Information Sharing: ize enables red team members
  to share crucial findings and intelligence seamlessly. For instance,
  if one team member discovers AWS STS credentials or other important
  information, they can easily save it to the shared database using ize.
  This facilitates real-time collaboration and ensures that valuable
  insights are accessible to the entire team.

- Centralized Artifact Collection: ize simplifies the process of
  collecting and managing artifacts such as screenshots, videos, logs,
  and other relevant data. Red team members can upload these artifacts
  directly to object storage via ize, ensuring that all essential
  information is securely stored and organized for future reference
  and reporting.

- Secure and Efficient: With ize, security and efficiency are paramount.
  The tool prioritizes data security by implementing robust encryption
  and access control mechanisms. Additionally, ize's intuitive interface
  and streamlined workflows empower red teams to focus on their objectives
  without being bogged down by cumbersome processes.

Whether you're conducting penetration tests, red team exercises, or
security assessments, ize is your trusted companion for collaborative
information sharing and artifact management. Empower your red team with
ize and elevate your offensive security operations to new heights.
